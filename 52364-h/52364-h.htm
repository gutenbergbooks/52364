<p class='c009'><em>Scene.—Emma's boudoir. A door on the left leads to the palace
courtyard; another, centre back, opens into private
apartments, which have no other entrance. The room is
furnished befitting the dignity of a princess. Emma, in
gala-attire, has just returned from a great function in
honour of the Calif Haroun-al-Rashid's ambassadors.
Etta helps remove her cloak. The princess then throws
herself on a couch, while Etta stands before her admiringly.</em></p>

    friends, henceforth a wanderer.<br />Bid her begone at once, nor moan her fate<br />With
    others. Let her depart for presently<br />I come to seal a tomb that holds the corpse<br

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The dense live-oaks were swept with wrath,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The rubber trees swung roots in mire,</div>
      <div class='line'>A fine-leafed cedar tittered spite,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Magnolias were flushed with ire.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Alone within the garden pale</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A tall palmetto gently swayed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Serenely straight its feathered head</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Above all else had skywards strayed,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To catch the first, faint blush of dawn,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To linger long with sunset's glow,</div>
      <div class='line'>To trace the moon's illusive course</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From orange disc to silvery bow.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So strove the palm and was content</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To glimpse at times a furtive clue,</div>
      <div class='line'>To pierce the haze of mystery,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Emerging thence with leaflet new.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And as the leaf, fanlike, unfurled,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Its green was showered with radiance,</div>
      <div class='line'>Eternal truth had shed fresh light,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Another phaze! another glance.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And so the palm in stature grew,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In lofty thought and vision wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unmindful of a carping world,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Outdistancing the trees beside.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Nor hearkened to their small-leafed tones,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The rustling of close-quartered boughs,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Whose dark no errant sunbeam ploughs.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>An ancient oak, misshapen, knarled,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Whose prideful age man's care had crutched,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose groaning branches bent toward earth</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The slim palmetto gave no sign</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And yet at last these murmurings</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Had forced attention, drawn its thoughts</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It sought the reason, paused awhile;</div>

      <div class='line'>Then flashed the truth, itself could see;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Those other trees had vision slight.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And then the palm began to talk</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And told of dawn and afterglow.</div>
      <div class='line'>How skies touched earth with brilliancy,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It traced the seven-coloured bow.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It spoke of rifts in frothy clouds,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of silent lakes illumed with stars,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of earth-mirage in misty air,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of spirit force that light unbars.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The trees were still and hearkened now;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But shallow cups hold little draught</div>
      <div class='line'>And soon the weary listeners tired,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some curled their leaves, while others laughed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then beauty spilled and fell to earth</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where tiny flowers sucked up the drops.</div>
      <div class='line'>No single thought had gone awaste,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From some there came rich harvest crops.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Long afterward, when death had chilled,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A fallen log lay swathed in vine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whence sword-like cacti pushed their blades</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And orchids peered 'mid tufted pine.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Such beauteous decay still blessed</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And so time passed, the nearby settlement became</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A village, then a boastful town and road</div>
      <div class='line'>And searching railway broke the still and helped defame</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sequestered charm that God, through Grace, bestowed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And Innocence would shrink from noise and close her eyes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When drifting smoke showed progress near, like plant</div>
      <div class='line'>That's sensitive, that shrivels from man's touch and lies</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So piteous with tremulous leaves aslant.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Too weak for woodland stroll, a hammock-couch was strung</div>
      <div class='line in2'>'Neath lofty pines and there the young girl lay</div>
      <div class='line'>And watched a robin's second brood, or chipmunk swung</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On sapling bent, or butterflies at play.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>One heavy night she stayed without, till Evening Star</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Had blown a kiss, then dipped beneath some clouds.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>A silence crept, scarce broke by owlet's hoot afar,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While mists arose like ghosts in flaunting shrouds.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A rustling sound! but Innocence had dropped asleep;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Within her hand a dangling lily stem,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose cool, white bud unfolded tales that willows weep</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where broad green leaves and starry petals gem,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Where waters pause from maddened rush to catch the calm</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That slips through foliage, to rest awhile</div>
      <div class='line'>In reedy bays as man fatigued might search for calm</div>
      <div class='line in2'>'Neath roofing church, immunity from guile.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A rustling sound, a stealthy tread, some broken twigs,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And Guilt peeped low through scrubby briar growth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then pushed his ruthless way, nor cared that tender sprigs</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Refused to bloom, once heard his muttered oath.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He plucked a burr that pulled his coat askew, then brushed</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Aside some pollen dust, some larva-thread;</div>
      <div class='line'>His outward garb so sleek and glossed, with step that hushed</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He fast approached—above dark clouds had spread;</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But through the gloom, the lily bud was visible,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The pallid curve of maiden's cheek; one stride,</div>
      <div class='line'>He stood befogged, a something stayed against his will.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A something childlike, Godlike that defied.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For Innocence had wakened now and unabashed,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Unharmed she gazed at Guilt and pity lay</div>
      <div class='line'>Within her eyes, a pity blent with pain that lashed,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Till Guilt one blinding moment felt its play.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He sank to earth beseeching what? He scarcely knew.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Respite? was pardon past? He felt a touch</div>
      <div class='line'>As light as though from highest Heaven a Seraph blew</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A kiss that floated downwards bringing much.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>And on his heart he pressed the flower that Innocence</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Had proferred him, the lily bud that erst</div>
      <div class='line'>Had lain on waters cool and clear. It brought from thence</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some mirrored truth that Nature's self had nursed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But Innocence had breathed her last, one gasp, 'twas all,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While Guilt affright, scarce pausing, fled; once more</div>
      <div class='line'>The Evening Star shone forth, winds sobbed a lingering call,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The grave awoke with crimson flowers; new birth attained,</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
